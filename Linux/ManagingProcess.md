## MANAGING PROCESS

Every running process or daemon is given an identity number called Process ID __(PID)__ 

There are generally three type of processes that run on Linux.
1. Intractive Process
2. System Process
3. Automatic or batch process.

### 1. Intractive process
Intractive Process are those process that are invoked by a user and can intyract with the user. __VIM__ is an example of an
intractive process. Intractive process can be classified into foreground and background processes. __foreground__ process that you are currently intracting with, and is using terminal as it is stdin (standard input) and stdout (standard output).

A __background__ process is not intracting with the user and can be in one of two states - pause or running.

### System Process or Daemon
The process that run on the system and provide service but does not intract with console. Example: samba, apache etc.

### Automatic Process
