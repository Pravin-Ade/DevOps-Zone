# Kubernetes Taints and Tolerations:

In **Kubernetes**, taints and tolerations are powerful tools that control which pods can be scheduled on which nodes. Theyâ€™re essential for managing workloads in production environments, especially when dealing with dedicated nodes, special hardware, or resource isolation.

### What Are Taints and Tolerations?
**Taints:** are applied to nodes and allow a node to repel a set of pods.

**Tolerations:** are applied to pods and allow (but do not require) the pods to be scheduled on nodes with matching taints.
